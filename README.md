# Move-DelayedClick
If you'd like to click a little late without third party commercial program, try this code 

In my case, I cannot install commerical program at desktop in company.
Someday my company control security level, so I cannot copy to scaned document in front of scanner directly.
I can't help clicking at my desktop after placing document at scanner 40m away. then I go to scanner to get my document again. :(

So, I make this program!!
I just run this program adjusting time and place document at scanner, then I take mine :)
